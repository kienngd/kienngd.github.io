## Supercharge Your Local WordPress: A Quick Guide to WP-CLI ðŸ’»

WP-CLI (WordPress Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that lets you manage your WordPress site directly from your terminal. It's much faster than clicking through the admin dashboard\! Hereâ€™s how to get it set up and start using it on your local machine.

-----

## 1\. Get the WP-CLI File

First, you need the WP-CLI executable file. We'll use `curl` to download it.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
```

This command downloads the file and saves it as `wp-cli.phar` in your current directory.

-----

## 2\. Set Permissions

The file you downloaded needs to be executable. Use the `chmod` command to give it the right permissions.

```bash
chmod +x wp-cli.phar
```

The `+x` option makes the file executable.

-----

## 3\. How to Run Commands

To use WP-CLI, youâ€™ll typically run it by typing `./wp-cli.phar` followed by the command, like this:

```bash
./wp-cli.phar core download
```

### ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: Make it Easier\!

For a better experience, you can rename the file to just `wp` and move it to a folder in your system's PATH (like `/usr/local/bin`). This lets you run commands simply as `wp` instead of `./wp-cli.phar`.

1.  **Rename and Move:**
    ```bash
    sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp
    ```
2.  **Test:** Now, you can run:
    ```bash
    wp --info
    ```
    If you see the WP-CLI version info, you're all set\!

## 4\. Basic and Useful Commands

Once inside your local WordPress project's root folder, you can run these commands.

| Command | What it Does | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `core download` | Downloads the latest WordPress core files. | `wp core download` |
| `config create` | Creates the `wp-config.php` file. | `wp config create --dbname=local_db --dbuser=root` |
| `core install` | Runs the installation process (like going to `/wp-admin/install.php`). | `wp core install --url=local.test --title="My Site" --admin_user=admin --admin_password=secret --admin_email=a@b.com` |
| `plugin install` | Installs a plugin from the WordPress repository. | `wp plugin install contact-form-7 --activate` |
| `plugin update` | Updates all or specific plugins. | `wp plugin update --all` |
| `db export` | Exports your database to an SQL file. | `wp db export backup.sql` |
| `cache flush` | Clears WordPress and object caches. Essential after major changes. | `wp cache flush` |

use `wp --help` to see all available commands and `wp help <command>` to get more information on a specific command..
