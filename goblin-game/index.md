# Introducing the Goblin Game on Telegram: A Guide for Investors


The **Goblin** game is an exciting experience available on the Telegram app. As an investor, you need to wisely invest your coins to **open mines**, **hire workers**, and **upgrade tools** to earn more coins.  

One important thing to remember is that the cart has a limited capacity. You must claim your coins before the cart fills up. To avoid claiming too often, consider investing coins to upgrade your carts for more space.

Important notice is you **DONNOT need to invest any money to play** this game.

In the game, **mines 1 to 6** only produce **Bronze coins**. These coins **cannot be exchanged for TON** and cannot be withdrawn. However, when you reach **mines 7 and 8**, you can earn **Silver coins**. These Silver coins **can be exchanged for TON and withdrawn**, but the amount is not significant, so the main goal is to enjoy the game.

Additionally, you can receive **daily rewards** and **play mini-games** to earn more **Bronze coins**. Just a reminder, Bronze coins cannot be converted to TON and cannot be withdrawn.

As you play, it is crucial to maintain a **balanced strategy**. Avoid leaving your **coins idle** and ensure that your **mining activities run smoothly**. Keep in mind that as you level up, the investments and upgrades will require more coins, so **patience** is necessary.

**Very important warning**: the game can be **stopped at any time**. If it ends, you may **lose all your assets**. Play smart and have fun!
