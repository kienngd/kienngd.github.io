Below is the basic Python learning roadmap tailored to your needs:

## Getting Started with Python and Setting Up the Environment:
  - Install Python (use the latest version) on Ubuntu.
  - Get familiar with pip and create a virtual environment (virtualenv or venv).
  - Install and set up an IDE or text editor (VSCode, PyCharm, â€¦).

## Mastering Basic Concepts:
  - Basic data types: numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets.
  - Conditional statements (if/else) and loops (for, while).
  - Functions, lambda, and scope management.
  - Working with files: reading, writing files (txt, CSV, JSON).

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
  - Concepts of class, object, inheritance, and polymorphism.
  - Practice building classes and applying OOP in small projects.

## Working with Modules and Packages:
  - How to create, import, and manage modules.
  - Use pip to install and manage external libraries.

## Libraries for Automation and Data Processing:
  - **Automation and Web Scraping:**
    - Get familiar with the **requests** library for working with web APIs.
    - Learn **BeautifulSoup** and **Selenium** for web scraping.
  - **Data Processing:**
    - Introduction to **pandas** and **numpy** for data manipulation and analysis.
  - **AWS Integration:**
    - Learn and use **boto3** to interact with AWS services like S3 and SQS.
    - Practice writing scripts to automatically upload/download data from S3 and send/receive messages via SQS.
  - **Airflow:**
    - Introduction to Apache Airflow: installation, configuration, and DAG concepts.
    - Build automated pipelines using Airflow to schedule and monitor tasks.

## Integrating with AI Tools and Introduction to Data Science:
  - Learn how to use AI tool APIs (e.g., OpenAI API).
  - Brief introduction to AI libraries like **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** (not in-depth, just an overview).
  - Small project: Build a simple AI-integrated application.

## Real-World Projects and Knowledge Consolidation:
  - Build a complete automation project: from data collection (web scraping) to processing, analyzing, and integrating with AI APIs.
  - Integrate AWS-related tasks (using boto3 to work with S3, SQS) and manage automated workflows via Airflow.
  - Apply learned concepts through exercises and real-world projects.
