flatpak search vlc
```

This will show a list of available versions of VLC from different remotes.

## Installing Software Using Flatpak

To install an application, use the following command:

```bash
flatpak install <remote-name> <application-name>
```

flatpak install flathub org.videolan.VLC
```

You will be prompted to confirm the installation, and Flatpak will take care of the rest.

## Listing Installed Flatpak Applications
